How to upload changes to the online version of your site (on heroku)


1) Take a look at what has changed (you can run this as many times as you want):
    git status

2) Prepare to save all the changes to "git"
    git add -A .

3) Check what will be saved (if there are things you don't want there, ask a coach how to remove them)
    git status

4) Save all the changes for real this time
You can type any message you want, like "changed my picture".
    git commit -m "Here you can describe what you changed."

5) Finally, upload the new version online
    git push heroku master

6) (optional) If you want, you can save your changes on GitHub
That way, you can start the project from another computer for example.
    git push origin master

7) (optional) If you want, you can transfer data (blog posts, tasks, favorite food) to the heroku website
    python manage.py dumpdata tasks food blog | heroku run python manage.py loaddata2 -
