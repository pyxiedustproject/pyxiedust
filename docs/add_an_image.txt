How to add an image to your site

1) Put the image in the "static" folder (as an example, we call the file photo.jpg)

2) In your template, at the top, make sure there is a line that says
    {% load staticfiles %}
If it's not there, add it.

3) In the same template, add the image:
    <img src="{% static 'photo.jpg' %}">
