HTML is how you build pages on the internet.
It's made with "tags" which start with < and end with >.

Here's a short list of HTML elements you can use in your pages:

* <p>A paragraph of text</p>
* <br>: A "line break" (makes the text go to the next line)
* <hr>: A "horizontal ruler", a long thin line that separates elements
* <em>Some important text</em>: It will be shown in italics by default but we can use CSS to tweak that.
* <strong>Some very important text</strong>: It will be shown in bold by default but we can use CSS to tweak that.
* <img src="image.jpg">
* <ul>: An "unordered list" of items. Use <li> ("list item") elements inside.
* <ol>: An "ordered list" of elements. Numbers will be shown in front of each element. Use <li> inside.
* <a href="http://example.com">Text</a>: A link ("anchor") to a different page. 
* <h1>, <h2>, ..., <h6>: A title (and corresponding sub-titles)
